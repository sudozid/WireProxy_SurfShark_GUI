# WireProxy SurfShark GUI
A GUI application for easily converting SurfShark WireGuard to SOCKS5 using WireProxy

This is a GUI frontend for WireProxy which is made for SurfShark only. The program obtains list of all SurfShark servers using API, including WireGuard public keys of servers, lists it all and allows you to map a particular location to a particular port. Customizablity is limited for now, since this is only expected to be run locally.

Important things to note:

1. The SOCKS5 proxies have no authentication, fine for local use.
2. The json config files are stored in plain text, including your public and private keys. Again, fine for local use only.
3. Only tested on Windows, may work on Linux, haven't tested.

How to use on Windows.

I. Get your public and private keys from the my.surfshark.com portal. On my.surfshark.com:
  1. Click on "Manual Setup"
  2. Click on "Desktop or mobile"
  3. Click on "I don't have a key pair" to generate a new one.
  4. Click on "Genrate a new key pair".
  5. Type in a name, then click "Next". Keep the window with the keys open.
II. Clone this project and copy it wherever you want. Eg. C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WireProxy_SurfShark_GUI.
III. Open cmd.exe and then change directory "cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\WireProxy_SurfShark_GUI".
IV. Activate a venv for ease of use using this command "python -m venv venv" and "venv\Scripts\activate"
V. Install the required modules using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
VI. Run "python wireproxy_manager.py"
VII. Take the public and private keys from SurfShark site and paste it in the GUI, then click update keys.
VIII. Select a country/city, in this case I took United Kingdom, select a port, I used port 6000. Click on "Add Proxy"
IX. Click on "Start" button.
X. You can now check and see if the proxy is working using curl or some other tool "curl --socks5 127.0.0.1:6000 http://httpbin.org/ip"
